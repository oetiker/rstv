# rstv — idiomatic Rust port of Turbo Vision

**What this is:** a faithful Rust port of **magiblot/tvision** (modern C++ Turbo
Vision). The goal is a framework a C++ tvision veteran recognizes on sight, but
that is native Rust.

## Read these first
- **`docs/PORTING-GUIDE.md`** — the deviation reference. We port *faithfully*
  from the C++; this guide documents **only the places we deviate** (D1–D13),
  each as *Baseline → Deviation → Integration*. Appendix A = C++→Rust symbol
  lookup. Appendix B = the **mechanical per-class porting recipe**.
- **`docs/PORT-ORDER.md`** — dependency-ordered checklist of 92 classes in 6
  phases, with verified C++ file mappings, target Rust modules, and
  `FOUNDATION`/`MECHANICAL`/`INFRA` tags. Port in this order.

## Source trees (not in this repo)
- **Port FROM:** `/home/oetiker/scratch/tvision-spec/magiblot-tvision/`
  (headers `include/tvision/`, impl `source/tvision/`, platform
  `source/platform/`). This is the source of truth — port its behavior verbatim.
- **Lessons reference only:** `/home/oetiker/scratch/tvision-spec/tvision/` is a
  working **Go** port. It was already mined for lessons. **Never reference the Go
  port in the guide or commits** — the guide is purely C++→Rust.

## Methodology (lean by design)
1. **Faithful by default.** If a class/behavior isn't called out as a deviation,
   translate it straight from the C++. No per-file design.
2. **Deviations are pre-decided** in the guide. Apply the relevant D-rules
   mechanically (Appendix B has the line-level substitution table).
3. **Division of labor:** `INFRA` (net-new substrate) and `FOUNDATION`
   (pattern-setting classes) need careful Opus/human work. `MECHANICAL` leaves
   are handed to **Sonnet** via Appendix B + the PORT-ORDER row — they need
   near-zero judgment. Parallelizable batches are listed in PORT-ORDER.md.
4. **Snapshot tests are the verification** (D11): port a piece, run it on the
   `HeadlessBackend`, snapshot, compare to C++ behavior. No heavy upfront plans.

## Locked decisions (details in the guide)
Crate `tvision`, house style `tv::`; drop `T` prefix; `snake_case` methods;
constant families → open newtypes with SCREAMING_SNAKE assoc consts
(`tv::Command::OK`); inheritance → `View` trait + `ViewState` composition;
pointers → `ViewId` handles + downward `Context`; events → `enum Event` + match;
flag words → struct-of-bools; palette+glyphs → `Theme`; whole-tree redraw + diff
(no damage tracking); modal loops → single loop + capture stack; `TStreamable`
dropped (serde if revived). Stack: crossterm (behind a `Backend` trait) →
vendored ratatui cell-buffer+diff (MIT) → retained view tree + event loop.

## Current state
- Planning docs written and committed; methodology established.
- **No Cargo crate yet** — only `mise.toml` (rust = latest) and `docs/`.
- Git initialized on `main`; 2 commits so far.

## Next step
Scaffold the `tvision` crate (Cargo.toml, `lib.rs`, module skeleton per
PORTING-GUIDE §13), then build the **Phase 0 `INFRA`** substrate (geometry,
`Color`/`Style`, vendored cell buffer + diff, `ViewId` arena, `Backend` +
`HeadlessBackend`, `Clock`/timer, capture stack, `Context`). That substrate
unlocks every later `MECHANICAL` widget and all snapshot tests.
